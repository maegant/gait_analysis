# gait_analysis
This repository houses the code used to compute various metrics associated with experimental data from exoskeleton locomotion

___

## Downloading Experimental Data
Since repositories are not intended to store large datasets, the exoskeleton time-series data is instead stored on [Mendeley Data](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/xtdnb2zdxj/draft?a=770eee4c-f3ae-4199-927d-1bd656cc3c7c).

Thus, please manually download the data and extract it to the 'Processed Logs'  folder.

___
## Processing Scripts
After downloading the data, you should be able to run the following script to compute the associated metrics (in MATLAB):
```
plot_all_metrics()
```
